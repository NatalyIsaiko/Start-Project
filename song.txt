I will always love you
 
If I should stay
I would only be in your way.
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you
Every step of the way.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
You my darling you mmm...
Bittersweet memories,
That is all I'm taking with me.
So goodbye, please don't cry.
We both know I'm not what you, you need.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have
All you've dreamed of.
And I'm wishing you joy
And happiness.
But above all this, I'm wishing you love.
