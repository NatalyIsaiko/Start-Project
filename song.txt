I will always love you
 
If I should stay
I would only be in your way.
So I'll go but I know
I'll think of you
Every step of the way.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.
You my darling you mmm...
Bittersweet memories,
That is all I'm taking with me.
So goodbye, please don't cry.
We both know I'm not what you, you need.

And I will always love you.
I will always love you.

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have
All you've dreamed of.
And I'm wishing you joy
And happiness.
But above all this, I'm wishing you love.

New song 

Million dollar bill
 
Oh oh oh yeah
Ooh oh ooh oh oh

Came in the door
Checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for
Is staring in my face

They played our song
We hit the floor
He held me strong
And we danced the night away

I can see the way that he is making me feel
This way about his love
I’ve been looking for something like this
I’m saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh!

If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!
If you go left right up down
Make you spinning round and round
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!

It’s been a long long time
Since I fell, fell
Love has found my way oh oh oh
I’ve been looking (looking)
I’ve been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah

Can’t deny the way that he is making me feel
This way about his love
I’v been searching for something like this
I’m saying oooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!
